# Human-Activity-Recognition-Using-Smartphone-Data
Developed a machine learning model for Human Activity Recognition using smartphone data, achieving accurate classification of activities in daily living, and enhancing data-driven insights. The Human Activity Recognition database was built from the recordings of 30 study participants performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. The objective is to classify activities into one of the six activities performed.
